# 🌌 BlackHoleSimulation-V2

A visually stunning, physically accurate black hole simulator built with **Python**, **Plotly**, and **Streamlit**. Inspired by *Interstellar* and grounded in real physics, this project brings gravitational lensing, accretion disks, and spacetime warping to life—right in your browser.
